# ðŸ“˜ HR Skill Readiness & Upskilling Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Business Context

In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving tech landscape, organizations must ensure their workforce is continuously aligned with emerging technologies. HR departments face challenges in:

- Identifying current skill gaps
- Forecasting future training needs
- Tracking upskilling progress across departments
- Making data-driven training investments

Manual tracking through spreadsheets or scattered tools lacks real-time insight, leading to inefficiencies and missed strategic opportunities.
